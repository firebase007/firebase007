### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my profile on Github :) 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some side projects and building my personal brand. I'm also studying Computer Science at the University of Eastern Finland in Joensuu, while I also strive to get a permanent full-time role to continue improving my skills and stay relevant in the ecosystem. It's crazy I know, but I work hard to be at my best. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go in-depth as I plan to transition to Cloud Engineering in a few years time. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new open source Go projects and content creation related to Go and Node.js
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help in the area of large scale distributed systems and how they all play together.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about general software development topics and specifically on topics related to Backend Engineering. I have written Node.js for almost 5 years while breaking and fixing a bunch production systems/microservices in the process. I know Docker, some Kubernetes and a couple of AWS services. Looking to explore more of those.
