### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my profile page :) 

Interested in learning more about me? 

Here are a few answered questions, feel free to reach out if you have any other question(s) for me - 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some side projects while also studying Computer Science at the University of Eastern Finland in Joensuu. I'm also currently searching for a permanent full-time role in Backend Engineering at a great company with a great culture. It's crazy I know, but I work hard to be at my best. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go in-depth as I plan to transition to Cloud Engineering in a few years time. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on new open source projects and content creation related to Go and Node.js/JavaScript
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help in the area of large scale distributed systems and how they all play together. Please reach out to me if you are interested in collaborative learning. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about general software development topics and specifically on topics related to Backend Engineering. I have written Node.js for almost 5 years while breaking and fixing a bunch of production systems/microservices in the process. I know Docker, some Kubernetes and a couple of AWS services. Looking to explore more of those.
